## What is this repository for?

This is primarily a way to document my journey of learning [The Rust Programming Language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and all that goes with it (crates, frameworks, etc.). It may not be for you! I warned you)

This repository will be constantly updated with new learning resources (see the `README.md` in each topic), as well as new code that I will write to better consolidate the material. ~~I really hope so...~~
